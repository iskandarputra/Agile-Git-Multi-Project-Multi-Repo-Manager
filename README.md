## üõ†Ô∏è Customization
Tailor the script to your needs:

- **Projects**: Modify project names and associated directories.
- **Repository Cloning**: Add more repositories to manage.
- **Functionality Enhancement**: Extend functionality to suit specific requirements.

###  üìù Projects Configuration & Repository Management
Adjust project names and their associated directories to align with your project structure. Add or remove projects as needed:

```bash
# Modify project names and directories
projects=("PERSONAL" "PROJECT_1" "PROJECT_2")
PERSONAL_DIR="$HOME/Documents/personal_workspace"
WORK_DIR="$HOME/Documents/workspace"

# Define configurations for each project
project_1_config() {
    local PROJECT_DIR=$PERSONAL_DIR
    setup_project_config "$PROJECT_DIR" \
        "project_autoscript/repo_1/repos_management" \
        "project_autoscript/repo_2/repos_management" \
        "project_autoscript/repo_3/repos_management"
}

project_2_config() {
    local PROJECT_DIR=$WORK_DIR
    setup_project_config "$PROJECT_DIR" \
        "project_1/repo_1_folder/your_git_repo" \
        "project_1/repo_2_folder/your_git_repo" \
        "project_1/repo_3_folder/your_git_repo" \
        "project_1/repo_4_folder/your_git_repo" \
        "project_1/repo_5_folder/your_git_repo" \
        "project_1/repo_6_folder/your_git_repo" \
        "project_1/repo_7_folder/your_git_repo"
}

# Add more project configurations as required
```
###  üìù Sample Directory Structure and Repository Cloning

To set up a directory structure and clone a Git repository within your defined project structure, follow these steps:

```bash
# Create the directory structure
cd Documents && mkdir -p workspace/project_1/repo_1_folder
cd workspace/project_1/repo_1_folder

# Clone your Git repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_REPO_URL>
```
This sequence of commands demonstrates how to create the necessary directory structure for a repository within the `project_1` directory and clone a Git repository into the `repo_1_folder`. Replace `<YOUR_GIT_REPO_URL>` with the actual URL of the Git repository you intend to clone.

Resulting `Tree` Structure:

```bash
Documents/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workspace
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project_1
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ repo_1_folder
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [contents of your cloned Git repository]
```
Adjust the commands and structure as per your project requirements and repository locations.
